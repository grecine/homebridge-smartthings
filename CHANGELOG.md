# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.58] - Dryer & Dishwasher Support with Activity Notifications

### Added
- **Dryer Service** (#29): Devices with the `dryerOperatingState` SmartThings capability are now properly detected and exposed as Valve accessories in HomeKit with Active/InUse status and a remaining duration countdown. Active dryer job states: cooling, drying, refreshing, weightSensing, wrinklePrevent, dehumidifying, aiDrying, sanitizing, internalCare.
- **Dishwasher Service** (#29): Devices with the `dishwasherOperatingState` SmartThings capability are now properly detected and exposed as Valve accessories in HomeKit with Active/InUse status and a remaining duration countdown. Active dishwasher job states: airwash, cooling, drying, preDrain, prewash, rinse, spin, wash, wrinklePrevent.
- **Optional Contact Sensor for Dryers and Dishwashers**: New `ExposeContactSensorForDryers` and `ExposeContactSensorForDishwashers` config toggles enable Activity Notifications in Apple Home for dryers and dishwashers, using the same Contact Sensor workaround as the washer.

## [1.0.57] - Washer Activity Notifications via Contact Sensor & onGet Performance Fix

### Added
- **Optional Contact Sensor for Washer Activity Notifications** (#29): HomeKit's Valve service (used by the washer) does not support Activity Notifications — only locks and sensors do. When the new `ExposeContactSensorForWashers` toggle is enabled in plugin settings, a Contact Sensor is added as a secondary service alongside the existing Valve on washer accessories. The sensor opens when a wash cycle is active (wash, rinse, spin, weightSensing, wrinklePrevent, drying) and closes when the cycle finishes or the machine stops. This allows users to enable Activity Notifications in Apple Home and receive push notifications when their washer starts and finishes a cycle.

### Fixed
- **"Slow to respond" Homebridge warning on characteristic reads**: All `onGet` handlers (e.g., switch state, lock state, sensor values) were blocking on a synchronous SmartThings API call whenever the 5-second status cache expired, causing Homebridge to flag the plugin as slow. Handlers now return cached device state immediately and trigger a background refresh when stale. Polling and webhook events continue to push fresh values via `updateCharacteristic()` as before. Only the very first read at startup blocks on the API call to populate initial state.

## [1.0.56] - 401 Token Refresh Race Fix & Washer Poll Rate

### Fixed
- **Persistent 401 errors when multiple devices poll simultaneously** (#28): When the access token expired, multiple devices polling at the same time each independently attempted to refresh the token. This race condition could corrupt the refresh token state (especially with rotating refresh tokens), causing a permanent 401 loop with no recovery. The 401 interceptor now uses a dedup lock — the first 401 triggers a single token refresh, and all concurrent 401s wait for that result instead of racing.
- **Auth flow log spam on persistent token failure**: When tokens are permanently invalid (e.g. expired refresh token), `startAuthFlow()` was called on every failed poll cycle, flooding the logs. It is now rate-limited to 3 rapid calls, then once per 10 minutes.
- **Washer/dryer polling too aggressive**: The washer service was using the sensor polling interval (`PollSensorsSeconds`, default 5s) instead of the switch/light interval (`PollSwitchesAndLightsSeconds`, default 10s). Washers and dryers change state infrequently, and the aggressive polling contributed to hitting SmartThings API rate limits.

## [1.0.55] - Air Purifier Double-Beep Fix on Mode Switch

### Fixed
- **Air Purifier double-beep when switching Auto↔Manual** (#24): When switching between Auto and Manual modes, HomeKit sends `setActive(1)` alongside mode/speed changes even when the device is already on. The fan mode debounce correctly collapses mode and speed into one command, but `setActive(1)` was sent immediately as a redundant `switch on` — causing the Samsung purifier to beep once for the no-op switch command and once for the actual mode change. The plugin now checks the cached device status before sending `switch on`; if the device is already on, the redundant command is skipped. Turning off always sends immediately, and turning on from off works normally.

## [1.0.54] - Fix Thermostat Custom Mode Commands (HTTP 422)

### Fixed
- **Custom thermostat modes fail with HTTP 422** (#25): Custom modes like `radiatingfloor` configured via `thermostatModeOverrides` were sent as direct command names (e.g. `{"command":"radiatingfloor"}`), which SmartThings rejects. Now uses the canonical `setThermostatMode` command with the mode as an argument (`{"command":"setThermostatMode","arguments":["radiatingfloor"]}`), which works for both standard and custom modes.

## [1.0.53] - Configurable Thermostat Mode Mapping

### Added
- **Thermostat Mode Overrides** (#25): New `thermostatModeOverrides` config option to control which SmartThings thermostatMode is sent when HomeKit requests HEAT or COOL. This lets users with non-standard HVAC systems (e.g. Koolnova with `radiatingfloor`, `radiatingfloorandhotair`) choose which mode maps to HomeKit HEAT/COOL on a per-device basis. Devices without overrides continue to use the defaults (`heat`/`cool`).
  - Configure per device by name (case-insensitive matching)
  - Available in the Homebridge UI under "Thermostat Mode Overrides"
  - Only affects the SET direction (HomeKit → SmartThings); GET direction already handles custom modes correctly

## [1.0.52] - Generic Thermostat Switch-Based Power State Fix

### Fixed
- **Thermostat showing active when zone is off** (#25): For third-party thermostats (e.g. Koolnova) that expose both `switch` and `thermostatMode`, the plugin now checks `switch` first to determine the real power state. These devices keep `thermostatMode` at its last value (e.g. `heat`) even when the zone is powered off via `switch`. Previously this caused all zones to appear as active/heating in HomeKit regardless of actual state.
- **Atomic switch + mode commands**: Setting thermostat state from HomeKit now bundles `switch` and `thermostatMode` into a single SmartThings API call (matching the AirConditionerService pattern), avoiding race conditions from separate fire-and-forget calls.
- **Real-time temperature events**: Incoming `temperature` webhook events are now correctly handled by ThermostatService. Previously, temperature events would fall through to the thermostatMode handler and incorrectly set the heating/cooling state to HEAT.
- **Real-time switch events**: Incoming `switch: off` webhook events for thermostat devices now immediately update both current and target state to OFF in HomeKit.
- **isOnline() method call**: Fixed `isOnline` being checked as a property (always truthy) instead of called as a method, so the offline guard in `setTargetHeatingCoolingState` now works correctly.

## [1.0.51] - Air Purifier Command Debounce Improvements & Offline Log Spam Fix

### Fixed
- **Air Purifier double/triple beeps (improved)**: v1.0.50 debounce only handled the Manual direction. Switching between Auto and Manual still caused 2 beeps because HomeKit sends `setTargetAirPurifierState` and `setRotationSpeed` near-simultaneously in both directions. All fan mode commands now go through a unified debounce with order-independent priority resolution (Auto > RotationSpeed > Manual default), ensuring only a single `setFanMode` command is sent regardless of callback ordering.
- **Offline device log spam** (#26): When a device is offline (e.g. washer in standby), every HomeKit characteristic query logged `"<device> is offline"` at info level. With multiple services and short poll intervals, this produced 10+ messages per cycle. Changed to debug level and added missing `return` to avoid unnecessary API calls to SmartThings for known-offline devices.

## [1.0.50] - Air Purifier Command Debounce & Sensor Fixes

### Fixed
- **Air Purifier double beeps**: Switching to Manual mode in HomeKit previously sent two SmartThings commands simultaneously (one from the mode selector, one from the rotation speed slider), causing the purifier to beep 2-3 times. Mode and speed commands are now debounced — when switching to Manual, the plugin waits 500ms for a rotation speed update before sending any command, ensuring only a single `setFanMode` is sent.
- **Air quality event overwriting PM2.5-based value**: Real-time `airQualitySensor` webhook events would overwrite the accurate PM2.5-derived air quality with the unreliable SmartThings value (which often returns 1/"Excellent" regardless of actual conditions). The event handler now skips `airQualitySensor` events when `dustSensor` is available, matching the polling logic introduced in v1.0.48.

### Added
- **`veryFineDustSensor` optional capability**: Samsung air purifiers that report `veryFineDustSensor` (PM1.0) now have this capability consumed by the AirPurifierService, preventing it from being left unmatched during service registration.

## [1.0.49] - Generic Thermostat Support (temperatureSetpoint)

### Added
- **Generic thermostat support**: Devices using the `temperatureSetpoint` capability (single unified setpoint) are now recognized as thermostats in HomeKit. Previously these devices appeared as a simple switch + temperature sensor. This supports third-party HVAC systems like Koolnova that integrate with SmartThings using `temperatureSetpoint` instead of the standard `thermostatHeatingSetpoint`/`thermostatCoolingSetpoint` split.
  - View current temperature
  - Set target temperature
  - Thermostat mode control (heat/cool/off)
  - Real-time webhook updates for `temperatureSetpoint` events
- **Custom thermostat mode handling**: Non-standard thermostat modes (e.g. `radiatingfloor`, `radiatingfloorandhotair`) are now mapped to HEAT in HomeKit instead of being treated as OFF. This ensures active heating modes from third-party systems display correctly.

### Note
- Users with affected devices (previously showing as switch) will need to remove the cached accessory from Homebridge and restart to allow it to re-discover as a thermostat. This can be done from the Homebridge UI under Accessories > Remove Single Cached Accessory.

## [1.0.48] - Air Quality Sensor Fix

### Fixed
- **Air Quality always showing "Excellent"**: SmartThings `airQualitySensor.airQuality.value` returns an unreliable value (often 1 regardless of actual air conditions). Air quality is now derived from PM2.5 readings when `dustSensor` capability is available, using WHO-based thresholds: <=15 Excellent, <=35 Good, <=55 Fair, <=75 Inferior, >75 Poor. Falls back to SmartThings 1-5 scale when dustSensor is unavailable.
- **Real-time air quality updates**: Incoming `dustSensor` `fineDustLevel` events now also update the `AirQuality` characteristic based on PM2.5 values, ensuring the air quality level stays accurate between polls.

## [1.0.47] - Samsung Air Purifier Capability Fix

### Fixed
- **Air Purifier capability mismatch**: Samsung air purifiers report `airConditionerFanMode` (not `airPurifierFanMode`) for fan mode control. Updated the combo capability match and all command/status paths to use the correct SmartThings capability name. Previously, the air purifier would incorrectly appear as a plain switch in HomeKit.
- **Fan mode command**: Changed from `setAirPurifierFanMode` to `setFanMode` to match the actual SmartThings API command for the `airConditionerFanMode` capability.
- **Fan mode status path**: Fixed status read from `airConditionerFanMode.airConditionerFanMode.value` to `airConditionerFanMode.fanMode.value`.

## [1.0.46] - Samsung Air Purifier Support

### Added
- **Air Purifier Service**: New `AirPurifierService` for Samsung air purifier devices, mapped to HomeKit's native `Service.AirPurifier`
  - Power on/off via `switch` capability (Active + CurrentAirPurifierState)
  - Fan mode control via `airConditionerFanMode` capability (Auto, Low, Medium, High, Sleep) mapped to TargetAirPurifierState and RotationSpeed
  - Filter life monitoring via `custom.filterState` capability (FilterLifeLevel + FilterChangeIndication at <10%)
- **Linked Air Quality Sensor**: Conditional `Service.AirQualitySensor` linked to the air purifier
  - Air quality index derived from PM2.5 readings (WHO-based thresholds) with fallback to SmartThings `airQualitySensor` value
  - PM2.5 density via `dustSensor` (`fineDustLevel`)
  - PM10 density via `dustSensor` (`dustLevel`)
  - VOC density via `odorSensor` (`odorLevel`)
- **Linked Humidity Sensor**: Conditional `Service.HumiditySensor` linked to the air purifier via `relativeHumidityMeasurement` capability
- **Real-time event handling**: Full `processEvent()` support for all air purifier capabilities via webhooks
- **Polling**: Automatic polling for Active state and RotationSpeed

## [1.0.45] - OAuth Wizard Popup Fix

### Fixed
- **OAuth Wizard popup blocked**: The SmartThings login popup in step 3 of the OAuth wizard was silently blocked by browsers for many users. The `window.open()` call happened after an `await`, which breaks the browser's user-gesture context and triggers popup blockers. The window is now opened synchronously before the async call to preserve the gesture chain.
- **Popup fallback URL field**: Step 3 now always displays a copyable URL field with the authorization link, so users can manually open it if the popup is still blocked by stricter browser settings.

## [1.0.44] - Samsung Frame TV, TV App Launcher & Washer Service

### Added
- **Samsung Frame TV Full Power Off**: Frame TVs now support true power off via a 3.5-second long-press of KEY_POWER sent over local WebSocket. The standard SmartThings `switch.off` command only puts Frame TVs into Art Mode — this bypasses that behavior entirely.
- **Art Mode Switch**: A separate HomeKit switch to toggle Art Mode on and off for each configured Frame TV. Appears as its own tile in the Home app for easy access and automation.
- **Local WebSocket Connection Manager** (`src/local/samsungWebSocket.ts`): Handles secure WebSocket connections to Samsung TVs on port 8002 (remote control) and port 8001 (Art Mode channel). Supports lazy connect-on-demand and automatic idle disconnect after 8 seconds.
- **TV Authorization Token Flow**: First-time connections prompt an "Allow/Deny" popup on the TV. Once accepted, the token is saved automatically and reused for all future connections — no manual pairing code needed.
- **Frame TV Configuration UI**: New "Samsung Frame TV Settings" section in the Homebridge UI to add/remove Frame TV devices with IP address, full power off toggle, and Art Mode toggle.
- **Frame TV Auto-Detection**: The plugin automatically detects Frame TVs by checking the `artSupported` field from SmartThings device status. A helpful log message is shown during startup if a Frame TV is found but not yet configured, guiding users to add the TV's local IP address.
- **`frameTvDevices` config field**: New array in `config.schema.json` for configuring Frame TV devices with `deviceName`, `ip`, `enableFullPowerOff`, `enableArtModeSwitch`, and optional `token` fields.
- **TV App Shortcuts**: Launch Samsung TV apps (Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, etc.) directly from the HomeKit TV input picker. Apps appear as additional input sources (type APPLICATION) alongside HDMI inputs. Select which apps to enable from the "TV App Shortcuts" card in the Homebridge UI. Uses `custom.launchapp` capability — no apps enabled by default.
- **TV App Shortcuts UI**: New "TV App Shortcuts" card in the Homebridge UI with a checkbox list of 18 predefined Samsung TV apps. Only selected apps appear in the HomeKit input picker.
- **`tvApps` config field**: New array in `config.schema.json` for selecting TV app shortcuts by app ID (default: empty).
- **Washer Service**: New service mapping `washerOperatingState` capability to a HomeKit Valve with Active, InUse, and RemainingDuration countdown for Samsung washers.
- **README section**: Added documentation covering Frame TV auto-detection, configuration options, first-time pairing, troubleshooting, and how to recover from an accidental "Deny" on the TV popup.

### Changed
- **TelevisionService**: When a Frame TV is configured, power off is intercepted and routed through the local WebSocket instead of the SmartThings API. Power on continues to use the SmartThings API as normal. On WebSocket failure, falls back to SmartThings API with a warning log.
- **MultiServiceAccessory**: Detects Frame TV devices by matching the SmartThings device name against `frameTvDevices` config entries (case-insensitive). Creates a shared `SamsungWebSocket` instance used by both the TV service and Art Mode switch.
- **Platform**: Registers Art Mode accessories as separate platform accessories after device discovery, with UUIDs derived from `deviceId + '-artmode'` to ensure uniqueness.

### Fixed
- **Art Mode Accessory Registration**: Fixed incorrect `PLUGIN_NAME` (`homebridge-smartthings-ik` instead of `homebridge-smartthings-oauth`) which prevented the Art Mode switch from appearing in HomeKit.
- **Art Mode Accessory Persistence**: Fixed a bug where the Art Mode accessory was unregistered and re-registered on every restart because its derived UUID didn't match any SmartThings device ID. Art Mode accessories are now excluded from the cleanup loop.

### Security
- **Dependency audit**: Fixed all 6 npm audit vulnerabilities (axios, form-data, glob, js-yaml, brace-expansion, diff) — 0 vulnerabilities remaining.

### Dependencies
- Added `ws` (^8.0.0) and `@types/ws` (^8.0.0) for local WebSocket communication with Samsung TVs.

## [1.0.43] - Real-Time Subscription Manager UI
### Added
- **Capability Subscription Selector**: New UI card in Homebridge settings to manually choose which capabilities get real-time SmartThings subscriptions (max 20). Available for users with webhooks configured.
  - Checkbox list of all discovered capabilities sorted by device count
  - Counter badge showing selected / 20 limit
  - "Clear All" and "Auto (by device count)" quick-select buttons
  - "Save & Apply Subscriptions" flushes and recreates subscriptions immediately without restarting the plugin
  - "Refresh List" to reload discovered capabilities
- **`selectedCapabilities` config field**: Optional array in config.schema.json to persist manual capability selections across restarts. Leave empty for automatic prioritization (existing behavior).
- **`available_capabilities.json`**: Plugin now writes discovered capabilities and device counts to Homebridge storage after device discovery, enabling the UI to display them.
- **Server endpoints**: `/capabilities` (read discovered list) and `/resubscribe` (flush + create subscriptions via SmartThings API) added to the UI server.

### Fixed
- **Security (XSS)**: Replaced all `innerHTML` string concatenation in the capability selector with safe `createElement`/`textContent` DOM building
- **Security (Input Validation)**: `/resubscribe` endpoint now validates capability names against the discovered list before sending to SmartThings API
- **Reliability**: `writeAvailableCapabilities` now uses async `fs.promises.writeFile` with atomic temp+rename instead of blocking `writeFileSync`
- **Error Handling**: Added JSON schema validation for `available_capabilities.json` and `smartthings_tokens.json` reads in server endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Plugin now logs a clear warning and falls back to automatic prioritization when all user-selected capabilities are invalid
- **UX**: "Save & Apply" button disables during the request to prevent duplicate flush+create cycles
- **UX**: Improved error messages in capability list loading with actionable guidance

## [1.0.42] - OAuth Wizard UI Fix
### Fixed
- **OAuth Wizard Flashing/Disappearing**: Fixed issue where the OAuth setup wizard would briefly flash and then disappear. This was caused by the `configChanged` event triggering `updateUi()` which would hide the wizard. Added state tracking to prevent the wizard from being closed when intentionally opened.

## [1.0.41] - Documentation Update
### Changed
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with entries for versions 1.0.37-1.0.40

## [1.0.40] - Pagination & Whitelist Support
### Fixed
- **200 Device Limit**: Fixed pagination issue where only the first 200 devices were fetched from SmartThings API. The plugin now follows `_links.next` to fetch all devices regardless of total count.
- **OAuth Token Refresh Bug**: Fixed critical bug where refresh tokens were not being saved after refresh in `auth.initialize()` and the 401 response interceptor. This caused "invalid_grant" errors after 24 hours for users who set up via the OAuth wizard.

### Added
- **ShowOnlyDevices (Whitelist)**: New configuration option to specify only the devices you want to expose to HomeKit. This is much easier than listing hundreds of devices to ignore when you only want a few.
  - Takes precedence over `IgnoreDevices` when configured
  - Case-insensitive matching with special character normalization
  - Useful for users with many SmartThings devices who only want to expose a subset

### Changed
- **OAuth Wizard**: Now saves `expires_in` value from SmartThings for accurate token expiry tracking instead of assuming 24 hours
- **Device Discovery Logging**: Now logs total number of devices discovered after fetching all pages

## [1.0.39] - OAuth Enhancements
### Fixed
- **OAuth Wizard Token Updates**: Fixed issue where re-running the OAuth wizard wouldn't update tokens if a token file already existed. The wizard now clears the old token file before saving new configuration.

### Changed
- **Improved Token Management**: Better handling of token file vs config token precedence

  - Uses httpbin.org as redirect URL to capture authorization code
  - Guided step-by-step process in Homebridge UI
  - Automatic token exchange and storage
- **Homebridge UI Integration**: Custom UI using `@homebridge/plugin-ui-utils`
  - Beautiful wizard interface with progress indicators
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Toast notifications for success/error states
- **Token Management Improvements**:
  - Tokens can now be loaded from config (wizard flow) or token file (existing flow)
  - Seamless migration for existing users

### Changed
- **Server URL Now Optional**: No longer required for basic setup
  - Only needed if you want webhook-based real-time updates
  - Webhook server only starts when server_url is configured
- **Webhook Port Now Optional**: Defaults to 3000, only used with webhooks
- **Improved Auth Flow Messages**: Better guidance when authentication is needed
  - Points users to the UI wizard instead of requiring manual URL visits
- **Updated README**: Simplified setup instructions focusing on the new wizard

### Technical Details

### Notes
- The plugin is now ready for Homebridge v2.0 testing
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes for existing users
- Comprehensive migration documentation provided

## [1.0.8]
### Fixed
- Corrected `.npmignore` file to ensure the compiled `dist` directory is included in the published package, resolving installation failures during Homebridge verification.

## [Released]

## [1.0.7]
### Fixed
- Addressed an issue where setting the fan speed to 0% in HomeKit would incorrectly turn off the air conditioner instead of setting the fan mode to 'Auto'. Implemented a mechanism in `AirConditionerService` to correctly handle this sequence and maintain the 'Auto' fan mode.

## [1.0.6] 
### Changed
- Updated minimum required Node.js version to v20.0.0. Adjusted `engines` field in `package.json` accordingly.
- Tested compatibility with Node.js v20.

## [1.0.5]
### Changed
- Corrected and updated CHANGELOG.md details for version 1.0.4.

## [1.0.4]
### Added
- Support for selecting "Speed and Windfree" under "Optional Mode For Air Conditioners" in the configuration. This option exposes separate HomeKit switches for the Speed and WindFree modes.
- Added descriptive text and a link to setup instructions ([README](https://github.com/aziz66/homebridge-smartthings?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions)) for the `client_id` and `client_secret` fields in the plugin configuration UI (`config.schema.json`).

### Changed
- Refactored optional mode handling in `AirConditionerService` to support creating multiple switches (`Speed`, `WindFree`) based on the single "Speed and Windfree" configuration value.
- Updated `config.schema.json` to hide the `AccessToken` and `WebhookToken` fields from the Homebridge configuration UI, as these are handled automatically by the OAuth2 flow and persistent storage.

### Fixed
- Resolved TypeScript build error `TS2345: Argument of type 'OptionalMode | undefined' is not assignable...` by adding a non-null assertion (`!`) where `this.optionalMode` is used in the single-mode setup path within the constructor of `AirConditionerService`, ensuring type safety in that specific code path.
